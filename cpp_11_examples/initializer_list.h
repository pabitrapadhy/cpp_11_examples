NOTE:
It could be a best practise to use Uniform Initialisation policy of C++ 11
because it is optimal, solves issue for C++'s most vexing parse

i.e Base() may be treated as a function, but Base{} is always an object.

Base()                   -> Base{}
Base(x, y)               -> Base{x, y}
Base* obj = new Base()   -> Base* obj = new Base{};
